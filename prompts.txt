- What's a good name for a video game that combines the old marble labyrinth game (played on a wooden board where you have to tilt the board to roll the marble around and avoid falling into a hole), with pacman, where you have to 'tilt' the game to make pacman move
- Create a minimal ebitengine main.go file that opens a 1280x720 window. Title the window "TiltMan"
- Create a file marble.go, which draws a circle. It should have a type Marble which remembers its position, speed, direction etc... and each update it should update its position based on its velocity.
- Add a file 'map.go', which defines the map. The map is described using an ASCII drawing, such as:

Where difference characters define what will be drawn in that square. The following characters are currently defined:

- # a solid wall
- . an empty bit of floor
- < a bit of floor that slows the marble down
- > a bit of floor that speeds the marble up
